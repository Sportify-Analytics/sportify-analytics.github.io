## Liverpool vs. Real Madrid

Less than a week removed from a dramatic ending to the Premier League season, and with hopes of a quadruple now gone for The Reds, Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool will look to spoil the party for Carlo Ancelotti and Real Madrid. A Champions League triumph for Los Blancos would mean history, as Ancelotti would become the first manager to win the tournament four times. For Klopp, it would mean ascending to Europe’s throne for the second time in four seasons, further solidifying Liverpool's place as one of Europe’s premier clubs with this also being their third final since 2018, all under Klopp’s reign. The managers are not the focal point of this matchup, however great they may be, the talent displayed on the pitch on Saturday will surely claim that honour.

One could argue that the two favourites for the Ballon d’Or award will be going head to head in Saint-Denis, with Mohammed Salah and Karim Benzema both putting on world class displays all season long, with the latter having shown his true quality ever since Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure from Real Madrid in 2018. Ronaldo’s exit from the Spanish capital also happened to be the last time Real Madrid were in a Champions League final, against this same Liverpool squad. That is one final Salah would gladly like to forget as not only does the defeat linger in his mind, but as does an arguably dirty challenge from then Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos, which led to Salah’s early exit from the final in the 31st minute. What followed was a 3-1 defeat for Klopp and company, goals which included a couple of howlers conceded by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius and a memorable bicycle kick scored by Gareth Bale, leading to Real Madrid’s third consecutive Champions League title, and fourth in a five season span. That was then, and this is now, and major changes have been made to both clubs in the four years since that night in Kyiv. 

Liverpool come into this match on heels of FA cup and EFL cup victories earlier in the season, both at the expense of Chelsea. Both of those games ended in 0-0 draws resulting in Liverpool coming out on top through penalties. Now playing in their third final of the season, expect a similar approach from The Reds, although they will have to be more clinical with the chances they create, because rest assured Real Madrid will be. Liverpool will come out with their usual immense pressing and high octane style of football, and a lot of that is going to come down to the play of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. Their ability to play high up the pitch and make decisive passes will add pressure onto Madrid fullbacks Ferland Mendy and Dani Carvajal, making it more difficult to retrieve possession and create chances going forward for Los Blancos. Along with the great play of the wing-backs, the performance of Liverpool’s front three will be a major deciding factor as to whether they can put Real Madrid away. The lightning fast Luis Diaz arrived in January and has arguably been the signing of the season along with being Liverpool’s best player since arriving. He will be the true catalyst up front when it comes to creating space for Mané and Salah, coupled with his pure finishing ability. Alisson Becker will also surely be kept busy by Real Madrid’s dynamic attack, and he will have to play up to par with his counterpart Thibaut Courtois, who has shown on multiple occasions the ability to keep his team in the game to allow them to claim victory when least expected. 

Shifting our focus to Real Madrid, their path to this final has been one filled with drama and climactic moments. From the round of 16 through to the semi-finals, Real appeared to be down and out with no hope of a comeback, only to find a way to prevail in thrilling fashion on all three occasions. The common denominator in all three of those comebacks was 19 year old central midfielder Eduardo Camavinga. The French youngster made an immediate impact on the match every time he was brought on off the bench, adding speed and physicality in the middle of the pitch, which ultimately improved the team’s pressing ability as a whole, allowing Real Madrid to maintain more possession and create the chances required in order to progress. He will most likely start the game on the bench, but expect him to come on midway through the second half, especially if the game remains close and Real need a spark. The key to Real Madrid’s performance will come down their midfield, which is their strength in comparison to Liverpool. The duo of Luka Modrić and Toni Kroos will have to endure the pressing applied by The Reds, while maintaining the poise to create the few chances required to score goals. A few chances is truly all they will need, as Karim Benzema and Vinicius Jr. have proven time and time again just how clinical they are, and if you don’t put them away when you have the chance, they will surely make you pay later. 

This match will be a spectacle for both die-hard football fans and casual watchers of the sport alike, as there will be plenty of quality from both sides. Expect Liverpool to dominate most of the possession along with creating a higher quantity of dangerous chances. They will have to play with caution though, as Real Madrid’s counter-attack is lethal and any decent opportunity will more than likely lead to a goal. Liverpool will be the better team throughout the 90 minutes, and potentially extra-time; however, Real Madrid appear to have the Champions League in their DNA and always find a way to put away the chances needed to come out victorious. My final score prediction is Liverpool 2 - 3 Real Madrid.

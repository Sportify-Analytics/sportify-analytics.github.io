Sundays are back! What is usually the most depressing day of the week has been filled with nerves, excitement, or even more lows (if you are a Falcons fan like me). With all the action from the first week of the NFL, there is a lot that can be overlooked - so why not highlight the most important takeaways from week one. Here are a few stats and storylines that I found interesting. 

## The LA Chargers are here to stay

Much to the joy of Sportify‚Äôs resident Chargers fan Scott Gray, the Chargers are for real. In a tough Week 1 matchup against a top tier Washington Football Team defense, Herbert and the Chargers put the league on notice. 

Last year this offensive line was ranked dead last by PFF and was the limiting factor of this team (minus injuries). The Chargers, having found their QB of the future, addressed the problem by signing All-Pro center Corey Linsley, guards Matt Feiler and Oday Aboushi and drafting tackle Rashawn Slater. Man these moves paid off. Against the likes of Chase Young, Daron Payne, Montez Sweat, and Jonathan Allen - who are all first rounders by the way - the rebuilt offensive line gave up the lowest pressure rate in the NFL for Week 1; 12% (6 pressures out of 49 dropbacks). This is outstanding stuff, and barring injuries this should be one of the premier units in the NFL. 

So I‚Äôll be honest. Like most, I was not a fan of Justin Herbet coming out of Oregon. I thought he lacked proper decision-making and just wasn‚Äôt built for the NFL. Even after his record-breaking rookie season I thought I needed to see more.There‚Äôs nothing else to wait and see for, he‚Äôs the truth.. Herbert is on his way to being a top 5 quarterback in this league and shined in Week 1 (minus the rezone interception). On third down (the money down), Herbie was 13/16 for 160 yards, 11 first downs and one TD. This is big time stuff from the kid, especially against this Football Team defense. With the help of new offensive coordinator (OC) Joe Lombardi, this offense is primed to take a big leap this season.

The defense looked solid and played into what Brandon Staley wants to do. They surrendered only 133 yards in the air, thanks to the return of stud safety Derwin James who was one of the top graded players this week with a 90.0 PFF grade. 

This team looks and feels the part. While competition in the AFC is stiff, especially in their division where each team secured a win in Week 1, the vast improvement by the Chargers will make them a tough out for any team. 

## Cardinals leave the nest?

The Cardinals shined in the box score and pulled off the upset against a talented Tennessee Titans team. While there is plenty to be excited about - Kyler Murray with 5 TDs - I‚Äôm still worried about this inconsistent Kliff Kingsburry offense. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Kyler is a stud. He led the NFL in ‚Äòbig time throws‚Äô this week and made highlight reel after highlight reel. 
The only issue is most of these big plays came after the play broke down, which doesn‚Äôt seem like an issue but it is. If you are consistently leaning on your quarterback to make lemonade out of lemons, this offense is sure to stall out eventually. Just ask the Ravens and Lamar Jackson after their Week 1 loss to the Raiders.  

On the lighter side of things, this Cardinals front seven looked the part. JJ Watt and Chandler Jones drew the major headlines (Jones had 5 sacks so well deserved), but for me, second year man Isaiah Simmons was impressive. Simmons came into the league as a hybrid safety-linebacker who struggled to adapt to the NFL. It seems Simmons has figured it out, as he recorded 9 tackles with 2 passes defended, 1 interception and 1 massive hit on King Henry.

Simmons made his case for comeback player of the year and is someone to keep your eye on throughout the course of the season. 

## The Toothless Titans
On the other side of that game you have the disappointment that was the Tennessee Titans. The Titans offense looked bad. The offensive line was bullied all game, specifically Taylor Lewan, who is coming off an ACL injury but still. 

In 2019 with OC Nicholas Cage... I mean Arthur Smith, the Titans were dominating teams and ranked 1st in early down play-action rate with 46% frequency. After losing Mr. Smith to my Falcons (you can have him back... jk), the TItans promoted Todd Downing to offensive coordinator. Now Downing was an OC with the Oakland Raiders in 2017 and is infamously known for having one of the lowest play-action rates of just 14%. Fans thought he learned from this experience but alas. The Titans ranked dead last in play-action rate in Week 1 with a pitiful 11% frequency. Now some of this can be due to how the game played out but still, 11%??? On top of this, star receivers Julio Jones and AJ Brown didn‚Äôt garner a target until midway through the 2nd quarter. How can you not have two of your most dynamic players involved in the game script? Todd Downing has some serious adjustments to make if he is to keep his job. 

## Visions of the Steel Curtain
The Steelers defense is once again dominant. If you didn't catch the game, poor Josh Allen was running for his life. Allen was pressured on over 40% of his dropbacks (NFL average is around 30%) and was clearly thrown out of his rhythm. Just look at these pressure numbers. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/steelers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@steelers</a> defense was absolutely ferocious on Sunday.<br><br>Most pressures by a pass rusher in Week 1:<br><br>1.

On the offensive side of the ball, it was first round pick Najee Harris feeling the heat. The Steelers offensive line was atrocious last season and with no notable offseason improvements, was just as bad as we thought on Sunday. Najee played all 55 offensive snaps but only managed 45 yards. He was hit behind the line of scrimmage on 75% of his carries. Yikes. When will front offices learn that getting a star running back doesn‚Äôt immediately solve your run-game problems (I‚Äôm looking at you Dave Gettleman). 

## Shane‚Äôs Seahawks
For every great chef there must be an equally as important sous chef. And while Russell Wilson was cooking on Sunday - 18/23 for 254 yards and 4 touchdowns - new OC Shane Waldron was deep in the cookbook. After years of former OC Brian Schottenheimer hell bent on running the ball for 2 yards per carry, we (and Russ) finally get the offense we deserve. The Hawks ranked 2nd in play-action rate this week with a 41.4% frequency which consistently kept the Colts‚Äô defense guessing incorrectly. 

## The Eagles are...good?
*big sigh* 
I‚Äôll be brief because it‚Äôs going to be a long season for the Atlanta Falcons. All the excitement of new head coach Arthur Smith and shiny new toy Kyle Pitts are all but gone. On both sides of the ball the Falcons struggled. This was particularly evident in the trenches and is a recipe for disaster going forward. If the offensive and defensive lines can‚Äôt improve,  we‚Äôll be in firm contention for yet another top 5 pick in 2022. I‚Äôm sorry Matt Ryan, we have failed you yet again. 

The Eagles on the other hand looked sharp. New head coach Nick Sirriani and Jalen Hurts were all over the Falcons defense. Sirriani was scheming everyone open and Hurts delivered, posting an impressive 89.5 PFF grade which is tied for second with Jameis Winston behind only the GOAT Tom Brady. On his throws, 71% of them were to a receiver with at least 1 yard of separation. If Sirriani keeps putting Hurts in a position to succeed, this Eagles team could vastly outperform this season‚Äôs expectations. 

That wraps up the interesting stats and storylines from Week 1. If I didn‚Äôt mention your team, I‚Äôm sorry or you‚Äôre welcome? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll cover all 32 teams at some point this season, so stay tuned for more weekly NFL statisticas.

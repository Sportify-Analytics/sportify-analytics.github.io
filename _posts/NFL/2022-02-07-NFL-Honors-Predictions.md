As we approach the NFL Honors, we at Sportify reflected on the standouts from a tumultuous NFL season. We’ve got the usual suspects, with MVP, OPOY, DPOY, and COTY among others, but also wanted to show some love for the best coordinators in the league as well. Without further ado, here are our picks for the 2021 NFL Honors.

## MVP

Tom Brady: This isn’t breaking news, but Tom Brady is really good at quarterback. In his 22nd season he threw for 5316 YDS, 43 TDs and 12 INTs (in 17 games). Tom Brady threw 40 TDs twice after turning 42 (this year being his second year doing so at 44 y.o.), he threw for 40 TDs once in his 20 years before that. He had great weapons all season, but in classic TB12 fashion still targeted seven different receivers over 50 times. His retirement makes this bittersweet, and no one should have any problems with him winning the MVP this season if he does - it wouldn’t be a career achievement award. Tom Brady was one of the best players in the league this year at 44 years old. He’s looked better since coming to Tampa than he did the last few years in New England, and this season won’t just be one of the best seasons any athlete has had over the age of 40. Brady turned in arguably one of the top 3 seasons of his GOAT career, and he’s the best quarterback of ALL TIME.  He’s not the betting odds favorite to win MVP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI">but stranger things have happened</a>. Getting shut out in week one by the Saints was bizarre, even if they also got Aaron Rodgers to produce his worst week of the year. It was the most Brady was sacked all year, and in my opinion 44 years old is too old to be hit by an NFL lineman - even if you don’t eat strawberries. Tom Brady carried a beleaguered Patriots franchise into a two-decades-consuming empire, alongside the GOAT coach Belichick. Then in 2021 he moved somewhere with awesome weather, but devoid of NFL relevance since 2003… When the billboard hot 100’s top five songs looked like this:

While it was the first SuberBowl win in Tampa’s franchise history, it actually happened two years after Brady’s first SuperBowl win of his career. 
He’s the best to ever do it, and there’s a pretty solid chance we won’t see any athlete replicate this kind of career again. Tom Brady won his first SuperBowl in 2001 and his last SuperBowl in 2021. If anyone could win MVP and ride off into the sunset, it would be fitting that it was him.


Aaron Rodgers: After a season full of off the field nonsense, cancel culture strikes again in the form of Amanjit’s and Cole’s votes against Rodgers as the MVP. Just kidding. He acted like a jackass all year, but when he stepped behind center during the regular season - Aaron Rodgers could practically do no wrong. He threw for 4115 YDS 37 TDs with only 4 INTs (in 16 games) to go along with a number one seed in the NFC (which he blew, but this is a regular season award) and a completion percentage of 68.9% (3rd in the league). Rodgers led the league in passer rating, and percent of passes resulting in first downs. The Packers offense rolled all season despite losing their starting Tight End, All-Pro Tackle, All-Pro Guard and chances of hosting jeopardy. He had one dangerous weapon in the passing game and he went to him all season, obviously having Davante Adams for 16 games this season was a big part of his success… But let’s not pretend that Aaron Rodgers hasn’t had to make the best of his receivers in Green Bay. Rodgers’ second most targeted player of the season was Aaron Jones out of the backfield. He was awesome on the field all season, and frankly the meltdown in the playoffs was in part to his unwillingness to throw to anyone other than his top two options.That same loss has only produced jokes to get off at Rodgers while he’s publicly inviting them. I give to you, perhaps the only good thing to come from the Aaron Rodgers saga of spending too much time on the internet: <a href="https://twitter.com/kaushikisalive/status/1488060183133626368">https://twitter.com/kaushikisalive/status/1488060183133626368</a> )

 He was the most efficient offensive player in the league, and outside of a horrible week one, no one was more consistently great this year than number 12 in Green Bay. Aaron Rodgers might be an asshole, but that doesn’t mean he’s not the MVP.
